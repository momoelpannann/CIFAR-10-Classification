This project focuses on implementing machine learning models for data classification using Python. The repository is structured to provide clear organization and functionality, enabling users to understand the workflow and explore the codebase. It includes scripts for data preparation, such as CreateDataFolders.py, DownloadData.py, and ProcessData.py, which handle the creation, downloading, and preprocessing of data into a usable format. Additionally, Jupyter notebooks are provided to implement various machine learning models, including Bayesian Learning (Bayesian_Learning.ipynb), Decision Tree (Decision_Tree.ipynb), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MultiLayerPerceptron.ipynb), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN.ipynb).

The project is built using Python, and the required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. Some of the core libraries used include numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and torch. To get started, clone the repository to your local machine, create a virtual environment (optional), and install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. The file structure is designed for ease of navigation, with a src/ folder containing the core scripts and notebooks, alongside supporting files like .gitignore, requirements.txt, and this README.md.

This version of the project does not include pre-trained weights, meaning it focuses on code exploration rather than model training or testing. Users can review the implementation of each model to understand the techniques and workflows applied. The inclusion of a Convolutional Neural Network model allows users to explore a deep learning approach to classification, complementing the traditional machine learning models in the repository. This project is ideal for gaining insights into Python-based machine learning and deep learning methodologies, offering a foundation for further development or adaptation to specific use cases.
